For example, a financial stock trading application for the New York Stock Exchange, which is used in banks worldwide, has to display the time, date, and stock prices in United States formats. This application uses SetThreadLocale to set the thread locale to English (United States) then uses the NLS functions to format dates, times,.This locale is defined by LOCALE_USER_DEFAULT. An application can override either default by using the SetThreadLocale function to explicitly set the locale for a thread. Implementation of a language requires a corresponding locale.
