These.RegisterClassA function (winuser.h) Registers a window class for subsequent use in calls to the CreateWindow or CreateWindowEx function. Remarks If you register the window class by using RegisterClassA, the application tells the system that the windows of the created class expect messages with text or character parameters to use the ANSI character.The second issue is that the IMM normally retrieves Unicode characters ... Windows supports a Unicode interface for the IMM, in addition to the ANSI interface originally supported. Your applications should use RegisterClassW to cause the WM_CHAR and WM_IME_CHAR messages to retrieve Unicode characters instead of DBCS characters in the wParam.(ANSI) GetAltTabInfoW Retrieves status information for the specified window if it is the application-switching (ALT+TAB) window.

When a class is configured in this fashion, calls to CoRegisterClassObject with this CLSID will fail unless the process was launched by COM.Out-of-Process Server Implementation Helpers Four helper functions that can be called by out-of-process servers are available to simplify the job of writing server code. A COM server that registers multiple classes typically calls CoRegisterClassObject with REGCLS_LOCAL_SERVER for each CLSID it supports.

       "  'Positioning a File Pointer When an application calls CreateFile to open a file for the first time, Windows places the file pointer at the beginning of the file. An application can position the file pointer to a specified offset by calling SetFilePointer. The SetFilePointer function can also be used to query the current file pointer position by.This file pointer is a 64-bit offset value that specifies the... Each time a file is opened, the system places the file pointer at the beginning of the file, which is offset zero. An application can truncate or extend a file by using the SetEndOfFile function. This function sets the end of file to the current position of the file pointer. A file.SetFilePointer function (fileapi.h) Moves the file pointer of the specified file. This function stores the file pointer in two LONG values. To work with file pointers that are larger than a single LONG value, it is easier to use the SetFilePointerEx function.

SetFileIoOverlappedRange Associates a virtual address range with the specified file handle. SetFilePointer Moves the file pointer of the specified file. (SetFilePointer) SetFilePointerEx Moves the file pointer.Change description In previous .NET versions, FileStream synchronizes the file offset with the Windows operating system (OS) when it reads or writes to a file. It synchronizes the offset by calling SetFilePointer, which is an expensive system call. Version introduced .NET 6 Reason for change This change was introduced to improve the performance of.Appending One File to Another File The code example in this topic shows you how to open and close files, read and write to files, and lock and unlock files. However, before writing to the second file, the application uses SetFilePointer to set the pointer of the second file to the end of that file, and uses LockFile to lock the area to be written..We are developing a custom hardware and device driver. The custom hardware has a large RAM which is to be accessed similarly to a character-based file (not file system).
